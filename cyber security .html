                    <p class="lead" >Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices,
                        electronic systems, networks, and data from  malicious attacks. It's also known as information
                        technology security or electronic information security.  The term applies in a  variety of
                        contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.
                        Cybersecurity  is  the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital
                        attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at  accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive
                        information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business  processes.Also referred
                        to as information security, cybersecurity refers to the practice of ensuring the integrity,
                        confidentiality,  and availability (ICA) of information. Cybersecurity is comprised of an
                        evolving set of tools, risk management approaches,  technologies, training, and best practices
                        designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attacks  or unauthorized access.

            <h1>Advanced fraud protection</h1>
            <h2>Digital growth powered by transparent identity trust</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Digital growth coupled with meeting customers’ expectations for convenience are at the forefront of
                every organization’s digital strategy. The full lifecycle of customer engagement, from onboarding to
                daily productive use, is now an omnichannel process. While there are great benefits to offering services
                in a completely digital fashion, it can leave organizations more susceptible to identity-based threats.
                The challenge becomes knowing if new and existing customers are truly legitimate, without creating a
                painful user experience.

                IBM Trusteer® helps organizations seamlessly establish identity trust across the omnichannel customer
                journey. Through cloud-based intelligence, backed by AI and machine learning, Trusteer provides a
                holistic platform to help you welcome in new and existing customers, while protecting against malicious
                users.

            <h1>7 Types of Cyber Security Threats</h1>
            <h2>1. Malware</h2>
            <p class="lead">Malware is malicious software such as spyware, ransomware, viruses and worms. Malware is
                activated when a user clicks on a malicious link or attachment, which leads to installing dangerous
                software. Cisco reports that malware, once activated, can:<br>

                <strong>1.</strong>Covertly obtain information by transmitting data from the hard drive (spyware).<br>
              <strong>2.</strong>  Disrupt individual parts, making the system inoperable.<br>
               <strong>3.</strong>Block access to key network components (ransomware).<br>
                <strong>4.</strong>Install additional harmful software.<br>
            </p><hr>
                
                


            <h2>2. Emotet</h2>
            <p class="lead">The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) describes Emotet as “an
                advanced, modular banking Trojan that primarily functions as a downloader or dropper of other banking
                Trojans. Emotet continues to be among the most costly and destructive malware.”</p><hr>

            <h2>3. Denial of Service</h2>
            <p class="lead">A denial of service (DoS) is a type of cyber attack that floods a computer or network so it
                can’t respond to requests. A distributed DoS (DDoS) does the same thing, but the attack originates from
                a computer network. Cyber attackers often use a flood attack to disrupt the “handshake” process and
                carry out a DoS. Several other techniques may be used, and some cyber attackers use the time that a
                network is disabled to launch other attacks. A botnet is a type of DDoS in which millions of systems can
                be infected with malware and controlled by a hacker, according to Jeff Melnick of Netwrix, an
                information technology security software company. Botnets, sometimes called zombie systems, target and
                overwhelm a target’s processing capabilities. Botnets are in different geographic locations and hard to
                trace.</p><hr>

            <h2>4. Man in the Middle</h2>
            <p class="lead">A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack occurs when hackers insert themselves into a two-party
                transaction. After interrupting the traffic, they can filter and steal data, according to Cisco. MITM
                attacks often occur when a visitor uses an unsecured public Wi-Fi network. Attackers insert themselves
                between the visitor and the network, and then use malware to install software and use data maliciously.
            </p><hr>

            <h2>5. Phishing</h2>
            <p class="lead">Phishing attacks use fake communication, such as an email, to trick the receiver into
                opening it and carrying out the instructions inside, such as providing a credit card number. “The goal
                is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information or to install malware on the victim’s
                machine,” Cisco reports.</p><hr>

            <h2>6. SQL Injection</h2>
            <p class="lead">A Structured Query Language (SQL) injection is a type of cyber attack that results from
                inserting malicious code into a server that uses SQL. When infected, the server releases information.
                Submitting the malicious code can be as simple as entering it into a vulnerable website search box.

            </p><hr>

            <h2>7. Password Attacks</h2>
            <p class="lead">With the right password, a cyber attacker has access to a wealth of information. Social
                engineering is a type of password attack that Data Insider defines as “a strategy cyber attackers use
                that relies heavily on human interaction and often involves tricking people into breaking standard
                security practices.” Other types of password attacks include accessing a password database or outright
                guessing.</p><hr>
