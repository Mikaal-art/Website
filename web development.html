            <h1 class="mt-4 fst-italic">Web Devlopment</h1>
            <p><strong>Web development</strong> is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work
                that happens
                behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user
                experience.

                Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use
                depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.

                Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great
                career option.<br> It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a
                traditional
                university degree to become qualified.

                The field of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end
                (the server side). Let’s delve into the details.
                Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
                comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
                design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and
                network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

                Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
                sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
                content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

                For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
                developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
                organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
                related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may
                be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There
                are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack
                developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,
                while back-end developers deal with the servers. </p>

                    menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end dev, who writes a series of programmes
                    to bind and structure the elements, make them look good and add interactivity. These programmes are
                    run through a browser.</p>

                    The backend of the web consists of the server that hosts the website, an application for running it
                    and a database to contain the data.

                    The backend dev uses computer programmes to ensure that the server, the application and the database
                    run smoothly together. This type of dev need to analyse what a company’s needs are and provide
                    efficient programming solutions. To do all this amazing stuff they use a variety of server-side
                    languages, like PHP, Ruby, Python and Java.</p>
