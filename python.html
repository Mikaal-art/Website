                            <p class="mb-0">In Python functions, default arguments allow you to pre-assign values to parameters.
                                These values are used if the function is called without providing a value for that particular parameter.</p>

                            <p class="mb-0">A return statement is used inside a function to return a value or object  to the caller.
                                  function execution stops after the first  return statement encountered. </p>

                            <h4 class="fst-italic">Python Identifiers </h4>
                            <p class="mb-0">In Python,  like  naming  your friends or pets, you need to give meaningful names to the elements you use in your code.
                                 These names, called identifiers, help you and others understand what each variable, function, class, or module does. But unlike your pet goldfish, "Fluffy McFish face". </p>

                            <h4 class="fst-italic">Updating Strings</h4>
                            <p class="mb-0">Python strings are immutable, meaning you can't directly modify a string after you've created it.
                                 However, there are ways to create a new string based on the original: <br> 
                                 1.Conjunction (+ operator) <br>
                                 2.String formatting methods (f-strings, .format(), etc.) <br>
                                 3.String slicing and concatenation <br>
                                 Note that the original string is not changed in all these methods.
                                </p>

                            <h4 class="fst-italic">Namespaces and Scoping:Keeping Your Python Code Organized</h4>
                            <p class="mb-0">Imagine a bustling city with different neighborhoods. 
                                Each neighborhood has its own set of streets and buildings, but they all belong to the same city. 
                                In Python, namespaces and scoping work similarly  to organize your code.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="fst-italic">Namespaces: Containers for Names</h4>
                              <p class="mb-0">A namespace is a logical enclosure that groups names (variables, functions, classes) and associates them with their corresponding objects.
                                 Think of it as a specific neighborhood within the city of your Python program. Names within a namespace avoid conflicts with names in other namespaces.
