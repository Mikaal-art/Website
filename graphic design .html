                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Graphic design's history stretches far back. From the cave paintings of prehistory communicating
                        stories, to the invention of the printing press in the 15th century that necessitated skilled
                        designers for layouts and illustrations in mass-produced materials, the field has constantly
                        adapted to our evolving communication needs. The Industrial Revolution fueled the demand for
                        eye-catching advertising posters in the 19th century, while the 20th century saw the rise of
                        graphic design as a distinct profession with a focus on clean lines and functionality. Finally,
                        the digital revolution introduced powerful design software and birthed new specializations like
                        UI/UX design, solidifying graphic design's place in our modern digital world.</p>

                    <h4 class="fst-italic"> Introduction to Graphic designing </h4>
                    <p class="mb-0">Graphic design is the art of using visual elements like images, text, and layout to
                        communicate ideas. It's about combining creativity with clear communication to transmit messages
                        in a visually appealing way. Designers use their skills to create everything from logos and
                        marketing materials to website interfaces and packaging.</p>

                    <h4 class="fst-italic">The evolution of Graphic designing:</h4>
                    <p class="mb-0">Graphic design started with prehistoric cave paintings and evolved alongside
                        communication methods. The printing press in the 15th century created a need for layouts and
                        illustrations. With the 19th century's industrial boom came the demand for advertising posters.
                        The 20th century saw graphic design become a profession, focusing on clean lines and
                        functionality. Finally, the digital revolution brought new tools and birthed specializations

                    <h2>Tools</h2>
                    <p>Graphic designers have a toolbox at their disposal, both physical and digital, to bring their
                        visions to life. Here's a look at some essential tools:</p>
                    <h3 class="fst-italic">Hardware:</h3>
                    <h5>Pen and Paper:</h5>
                    <p>It all starts with ideas! Sketching initial concepts on paper allows for fast, free-flowing
                        creativity before diving into digital tools.</p>
                    <h5>Computer:</h5>
                    <p>The workhorse of modern graphic design. Designers use computers to run design software, manage
                        files, and collaborate with others.</p>
                    <h3 class="fst-italic">Software:</h3>
                    <h5>Vector Graphics Software:</h5>
                    <p>Programs like Adobe Illustrator or Affinity Designer excel at creating and manipulating vector
                        graphics, which can be scaled infinitely without losing quality. </p>
